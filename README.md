# Modified-Kaprekar-Numbers
This C# program finds and prints all Kaprekar numbers within a given range `[p, q]`. The `kaprekarNumbers` function squares each number, splits the square into left and right parts based on the numberâ€™s length, and checks if their sum equals the original number. If any Kaprekar numbers are found, they are printed; otherwise, it outputs "INVALID RANGE". The `Main` method reads the range from input and calls the function.
